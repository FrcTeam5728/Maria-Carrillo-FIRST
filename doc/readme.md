# Maria-Carrillo-FIRST/doc
## Place software-related documentation in subdirectories of `doc`.

These files should document any software processes, guidance, hints, or design details related to the project.

Adding new documentation here allows sharing, collaboration, and backup through GitHub, and enables branch-specific documentation changes to be directly associated with code (src directory).
